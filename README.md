## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. Early detection and treatment are crucial for effective management and prevention of complications. This project aims to provide a tool for automated malaria detection using machine learning.

## Features

- Upload images of blood samples for malaria detection.
- Obtain predictions on whether the sample is infected (parasitized) or uninfected.
- Simple and intuitive web interface.
- Backend powered by Flask, with a deep learning model trained on TensorFlow/Keras.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malaria-detection.git
cd malaria-detection
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

1. Upload an image of a blood sample by clicking the "Choose Image" button.
2. Click the "Predict" button to obtain the malaria detection result.
3. The prediction result will be displayed below the "Predict" button.
